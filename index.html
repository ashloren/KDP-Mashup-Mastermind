How You Can Legally Steal Classic,
Best Selling Fiction Books and
Call Them Your Own…
Collecting the Money On Others Hard Work!
Utilize Plots, Characters, Whole Written Sections of Other Books, Legally…and Easily!
Upload and Sell Your “Rip Off’s” At Amazon…They Actually Want You To!
Tap The Massive Fiction Marketplace…By Barely Writing A Word!
1098249_10151796409721011_963127727_nAshly Lorenzana here and I have something that will enable you to quickly tap the fiction marketplace without a lot of writing.

In fact, once you see this, you’ll realize that you won’t need much in the way of creativity or thought.


Do You Want To Grab A Piece of The Multi-Billion
Dollar Fiction Pie, But Feel You Couldn’t Write
A Novel To Save Your Life?
Writing a fiction book is tough. You have to come up with a plot, characters, development, write big scenes, pour hours into thinking and creating and writing and…practice.

Writing fiction is  just like any other creative endeavor. It requires practice and training to get right. Almost all famous fiction writers are famous because they write so much every single day.

Do You Have Time To Write For Hours Every Day?
Just To Get Fiction “Right”?
Yes, in order to write a good fiction novel, you need to spend hours a day writing. Who has time for that?

 I mean, most authors I know who are writing fiction take months to get their novel done, because they can only work on it an hour or two a day. Two hours a day for two or three months…

And then of course there is no guarantee the book will sell!

What If You Could Skip All That?
What if you could skip all the practice, most of the writing, and just make a few changes to other people’s books, stealing their plots, characters, writing and more?

What if you could that, and easily bank off of the names of classic literature, selling the books other people have written and yet have Amazon love you for it?

I’m going to show you how to do this inside:

Mashup Mastermind

Have A 20,000+ Word Novel Written…
In One Weekend!
Inside Mashup Mastermind I’ll show you all my tricks to quickly getting fiction written and selling in just a weekend or so.

Because you are legally stealing the work of others, you don’t need to world build, come up with a plot, write characters, develop those characters…instead, you create mashups of classic books (I’ll show you how and why it’s legal inside), banking off of their name and fame.
No Longer Fret – Stop Worrying Whether
All This Time Was Wasted!
There is nothing wrong with dumping months of work into a book…but if it won’t sell, then there is a huge problem! You’ve wasted hundreds of hours on a book that turns into zero income!

Don’t do that anymore.

With the techniques I’m going to show you, you will no longer spend hundreds of hours writing a novel.

So at worst, if the book is a flop, you’ve invested only a few hours – not hundreds!
Never Written A Novel Before?
This is the Perfect Place To Start!
No need to develop plot or characters, write big long scenes – it’s all been done for you! You just take what has already been written and utilize it!

This is perfect for people who haven’t written a book before. No need for creative skills or massive amounts of writing! Tap the fiction marketplace easily!
No Outsourcing or Ghostwriting Needed…
Unless You Want!
The great thing is you don’t need to outsource at all. You can do this all by yourself if you want. I’ll show you exactly what to do.

So save those few hundred bucks on ghostwriting and have it done in a weekend or less!

Of course if you do decide to outsource, you can. But instead of spending 300 to 400 dollars on Ghostwriting and outsourcing, you would spend less than 50 on a 20,000 word+ novel!
